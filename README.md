<h1>Summary</h1>
The visualization shows the relationship between gender and survival of the Titanic passengers.
Females, although being a smaller group than men, had a greater number of survivors. This shows that the advice women and children first held true during the critical moments of decision.

<h1>Design</h1>
1.
I chose a bar chart in order to show two things.
First that there were far more male passengers than female. Second that of those female passengers a much larger portion survived the catastrophe than of the male passengers. Even the absolute number of female survivors is larger than that of the males. In the sketch I compare the number of survived and perished passengers on the x-axis. The colors in the bars encode the gender. This should help differentiate between male and female.</br></br>
2. After feedback from my friend i made the following changes:
<ul>
<li>x-axis shows male and female passengers in order to convey a clearer message about the different survival rates.</li>
<li>y-axis shows number of passengers</li>
<li>color of the bars shows amount of people survived and deceased</li>
</ul>
</br>
3. The feedback from the discussion forum made me make the following changes:
<ul>
<li>clearer annotations for the color code</li>
<li>correct the tooltip to show clearer and easier to understand information</li>
</ul>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
1. Based on a sketch of my idea I received the following feedback:
<ul>
<li>if you want to compare the rate of survival between male and female passengers the chart should bring that idea across more clearly. Right now it doesn't jump to my eye. So I think this is something to improve</li>
</ul>
2. After refining the initial sketch i received the following feedback from the discussion board

Something that you may consider changing could be the legend encoding. Instead of "1" and "0" you could use "survived" and "did not survived", or "yes" and "no". I am pointing this out because for someone who is not familiar with the date set the meaning of "1" and "0" may not be very clear.
Allow me to make one more suggestion! When I hover over the two parts of the bars, a message shows up that labels the number of people who "survived" and "did not survive" as "survived". Maybe you could change it in a way that the both categories differ from each other. Or you could just write "number" instead of "survived".

<li>What do you notice in the visualization?</br>
First thing I noticed was the title and description, which was a well-written introduction. I noticed a small spelling mistake (i.e. 'unsikable', should be 'unsinkable'). Next, I noticed a stacked bar chart with the columns representing each gender and the y-axis representing number of people.
</li>
<li>
What questions do you have about the data?</br>
At first, I didn't know what the blue and the red color represented. I noticed the legend, but it didn't provide much information. I figured out from the title and description that 1 represented survivors and 0 represented non-survivors, however, I think the legend could be labeled more clearly.
</li>
<li>
What relationships do you notice?</br>
I noticed a big difference between the survival rate of male and female passengers on the Titanic with a much higher proportion of female passengers surviving compared to the male passengers. I also noticed that there were almost twice as many males than females on the ship.
</li>
<li>
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?</br>
I think the main takeaway is that there is a strong correlation between gender and survival rate on the Titanic. This was probably largely due to the priority given to women and children to board the escape vessels first.
</li>
<li>
Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?</br>
No - aside from the labels for the legend being unclear, I felt that the graphic was easy to understand.
