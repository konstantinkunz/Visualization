<h1>Summary</h1>
The visualization shows the relationship between gender and survival of the Titanic passengers.
Females, although being a smaller group than men, had a greater number of survivors. This shows that the advice women and children first held true during the critical moments of decision.

<h1>Design</h1>
I chose a bar chart in order to show two things.
First that there were far more male passengers than female. Second that of those female passengers a much larger portion survived the catastrophe than of the male passengers. Even the absolute number of female survivors is larger than that of the males.
